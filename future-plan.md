# Future Plan 

## Making tech club profitable 
Objective: Making business run decentrally using open source tools. 

As we approach the next phase of tech club. We need to incentivize all high contributors and fund our own open source projects. 
In this approach we still use open source projects to be profitable.
- Paid support for running the open source software 
- Intergrating the open source project 
- Custom builds based on user requirements 
- There will be no dual licensing

### Incentivize plan 
- The team that provided the service will have to provide a small percentage of revenue to a tech club open source project 
- The amount needed to given is upto the team
